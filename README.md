# Algorithm Visualizer

## Overview
This project is an algorithm visualizer implemented in Python. It allows users to visualize various algorithms and understand their operations through animations and step-by-step demonstrations.

## Features
- **Supported Algorithms**: List the algorithms your visualizer supports (e.g., sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).
- **Visualization**: Provides a graphical representation of how algorithms manipulate data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists).
- **Step-by-step Mode**: Allows users to step through the algorithm's execution to see how data changes at each step.
- **Customization**: Users can adjust parameters (array size, speed of animation, etc.) for visualization.
- **Export**: Optionally, allow exporting of visualizations as videos or GIFs.

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/algorithm-visualizer.git
   cd algorithm-visualizer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
- **Select Algorithm**: Choose the algorithm you want to visualize from a dropdown or command-line interface.
- **Adjust Parameters**: Modify any parameters (e.g., array size, animation speed) before starting the visualization.
- **Start Visualization**: Begin the visualization to see the algorithm in action.
- **Step Through**: If supported, step through the algorithm to observe each operation.
- **Export (Optional)**: If supported, export the visualization as a video or GIF for later reference.
